            <h1> About Me </h1>
            <p> Howdy!
            My name is Keith Crabb, I am a Junior at Texas A&M University, Majoring in Computing with a minor in cybersecurity.
            <br><br>
            My passion for computing started when I was little, helping my father around the Data Center at the University of
            Houston. I was the unofficial “data center rat,” as I was small enough to crawl around underneath the floorboards and
            run wires between the different server racks.
            <br><br>
            Starting High School, however, is really when my interest in computing and cybersecurity began taking off. I was lent a
            school laptop to help with my studies and immediately began exploring the system and its capabilities. Instead of paying
            attention during music theory, I was in the back of the room researching the basics of coding with C++ and researching
            how the internet was networked.
            <br><br>
            Over the years, I explored every nook and cranny of my school’s systems and pushed the limits of the equipment I was
            given. As I learned new skills, I began to teach others around me, turning those I taught into teammates, whom I led
            into new projects and exciting unexplored areas.
            <br><br>
            During my time at college, I ran across the Scholarship for Service Cybercorps scholarship, which is a program run by
            the National Science Foundation and Department of Homeland Security to attract and train the next generation of
            Government Cyber Professionals.
            <br><br>
            A few weeks after I applied, exhausted from staying up all night working on a final project, I arrived at my interview
            at the wrong time on the wrong day. Despite this, the program director made time for me, and a couple of days later, he
            reached out, letting me know that I had been accepted into the program.
            Since then, I’ve been admitted into a few other scholarship programs that are similar in nature and provide mentorship
            and professional development experiences that have helped me narrow my focus and prepare for a career.
