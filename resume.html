            <h1>Technical Skills</h1>
            <p> C++: I have been self-taught in C++ since high school and have solidified a working level of knowledge during my college
            coursework. My experience in C++ has also been invaluable in my cyber experience, helping me design and use the tools I
            need to get the job done.
            <br>
            Reverse Engineering: I have completed several challenges in reverse engineering and have developed a strong
            understanding of the open-source tools that are used in the process. I have completed several challenges through CTFs,
            most notably completing a Ransomware Reverse engineering challenge written in the GO language as a part of their <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/Cybersecurity/NSA-Cyber-Exercise/">NCX
            event</a>.
            <br>
            Digital Forensics: I’ve always been interested in digital forensics processes. Recently, I completed a LinkedIn Learning
            course covering the digital forensics basics, where I learned more about the Hardware and Software used along with the
            regulations and chain of custody requirements that come with the field.

            <h1>Areas of Interest</h1>
            <p>High-Performance Computing:
            Having experience with HPC environments since I was little, it has always been an area of interest for me. I had the
            experience of taking training with the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/ames/">NASA Ames Research Center</a> during the summer. I completed challenge problems on
            the NASA Pleiades Cluster alongside researchers and DoD personnel. As an intern with <a href="https://www.usaa.com/">USAA</a>, I had the opportunity to
            directly interface with a mainframe to conduct an audit on its security and operations. Learning more about how Z/OS
            configurations are managed and the additional security features employed through the Vanguard and RACF systems.
            <br><br>
            Cybersecurity:
            With my cybersecurity experience beginning in high school, I have done a great deal of reading and research about the
            field. Right now, I am set on a career in cybersecurity and have obtained scholarships and training to help me gain more
            in-depth real-life experience. I’ve spent time working as a Bug Bounty Hunter on <a href="https://www.hackerone.com/">HackerOne</a> and have participated in CTF
            challenges such as the <a href="https://nsa-codebreaker.org/home">NSA Codebreakers Challenge</a>. Spending time working through challenges with the A&M Cybersecurity
            club has also been a rewarding experience developing connections and peers in a wide reaching field.
