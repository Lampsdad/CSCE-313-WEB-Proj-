        <h1>My Prompt</h1>
        <p> Design me a website using HTML and CSS which will be the homepage of a company called "Funny Monkey Business" which is
        designed for the sole purpose of selling bananas. Let this website have a yellow top navigation bar which has the
        company name on it centered in bold white text. underneath this bar have two text boxes, one covering the left side of
        the screen which has this exact message copied, and one covering the right side of the screen which explains something
        about the company and its mission
        -----------------------------------------------------
        add a bar to the bottom of the screen that is thin and grey and includes a copyright for the company, add a third text
        box underneath the two you already designed and leave it blank with an HTML comment showing where i can add text
